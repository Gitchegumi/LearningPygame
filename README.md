# Gitchegumi's jounrey through Pygame.

## Current Progress
- I have installed the Pygame module on my laptop and desktop and started to read through a tutorial on pygame.org.
- I have started a shell for my first actual game that I will make on my own. A snake clone!

## Tutorial
> I have added example code for a bouncing ball as well as a solid color field and a moving circle.
