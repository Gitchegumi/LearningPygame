# Gitchegumi's journey through Pygame.

## Current Progress
- I have installed the Pygame module on my laptop and desktop and started to read through a tutorial on pygame.org.
- I have started a shell for my first actual game that I will make on my own. A snake clone!
- The shell, as of today 15 October, is an image of a little man moving around on a DnD map I had on hand. We're making progress!

## Tutorial
> I have added example code for a bouncing ball as well as a solid color field and a moving circle.
